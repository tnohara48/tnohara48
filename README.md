# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tatsu Nohara!

I'm a full-stack developer based in Japan, building practical web applications using Go, Python, PHP, and Java.

I create **production-ready portfolio projects** to demonstrate my ability to design, build, and deploy real-world systems with clean code and scalable architecture.
